# Census_Transportation_Data
Analysis of data from Census Transportation Planning Product (CTPP) to recognize the effective factors for using public transportation usage by the workers. As public transportation is a challenge in the US, to change this attitude, it is required that some basic social/infrastructural reasons are determined to find the sources of the issue or the path to improve.
The data is obtained from:
